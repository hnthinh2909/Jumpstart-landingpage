# Copy a Landing Page
My project this time is copy a landing page of Jumpstart on Themeforest
## Tools
I used Javascript - basic, HTML, CSS. Everything I used just skill basic.
Although it still has many bugs and is not beautiful, what I want to show is my daily progress.
### Result 
This is my website deployed on firebase.
* I still not add responsive for this web yet. 
* So you can review it with fullscreen
